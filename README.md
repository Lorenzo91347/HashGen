## Hashtag Generator

This project's purpose is to generate an hashtag given a string variable, and to test it using PHPUnit.

Includes a test_autoload.php file to make sure your autoload is working correctly.

To test the code, run "./vendor/bin/phpunit tests" or
"./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/HashTest.php" in your terminal(you can use the integrated terminal is VSCode,but I am not sure about other IDE's as I have no experience with them.)
